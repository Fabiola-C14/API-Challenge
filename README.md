# API-Challenge

## Part I-WeatherPy

A Python script was created to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this task, a Python library and Open Weather Map API was utilized.

A series of scatter plots were created to display the following information:
* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
